Loop Tracing (Slab-wise Calculation)
▶️ 1st Slab: (0, 100) → ₹3.00
consumed_units = min(350, 100) - 0 = 100
amount = 100 × 3.00 = 300
total_bill = 0 + 300 = 300

▶️ 2nd Slab: (101, 200) → ₹4.50
consumed_units = min(350, 200) - 100 = 100
amount = 100 × 4.50 = 450
total_bill = 300 + 450 = 750

▶️ 3rd Slab: (201, 300) → ₹6.00
consumed_units = min(350, 300) - 200 = 100
amount = 100 × 6.00 = 600
total_bill = 750 + 600 = 1350

▶️ 4th Slab: (301, 100000) → ₹8.00
consumed_units = min(350, 100000) - 300 = 50
amount = 50 × 8.00 = 400
total_bill = 1350 + 400 = 1750
